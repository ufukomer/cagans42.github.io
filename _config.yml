intro: |
  I am a software engineer who is most specialized at Backend and DevOps technologies. I have been working with APIâ€™s, automation tools and Backend Frameworks. I have experience in Nodejs, PHP, Golang, and Java programming languages. Technologies like Jenkins, Travis, and AWS (S3, Lambda, EC2, API Gateways, etc.) are also included in my work experience. I have 2 years experience at RESTFUL APIs and Database management systems and also I spent 4 years at working on Linux Management with Linux associated groups around the world. I have experience at Database Management Tools, such as SQL, SQLite related databases and Redis, MongoDB for non-relational databases. Now I try to focus on developing my knowledge at Java Enterprise Edition technologies such as Spring, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Maven with DevOps technologies.My biggest goal at my job is being a good developer, a good teammate, and being a specialist at specifically Backend technologies and DevOps. I like improving myself every time and love solving challenges. <br/><br/>
  I enjoy building fully featured and qualified products, with a good Product Management focus and apply best practices of engineering principles with clean code. It is really important to write clean codes to make qualified software, share the knowledge between a team, and even eliminate bugs before the testing step. In my recent work experience, we applied Code Review Standards with best practices. During this period, I learned and applied the Code Review Standards in my development. I have good knowledge of programming paradigms such as Imperative, Declarative, Structured, Object Oriented, Functional, Event Driven, Procedural. I always try to implement my project using the most proper paradigms. I believe that It is so crucial to know Data Structures and S.O.L.I.D principles to create good software. To build qualified software I also focus on implementing the design patterns like Singleton, Prototype, Observer, Factory. <br/><br/>
  I have always enjoyed working on software since I was a kid. I want to build qualified and scalable projects using new and reliable technologies. I like to write Medium articles, Solve Hackerrank problems, and contribute on open source projects in my spare time.
