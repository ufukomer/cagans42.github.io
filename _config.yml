intro: |
  I am an engineer with 15 years experience working in technology. I have primarily worked on the JVM, but have worked across a broad range of technologies thereon: Java, Groovy, Android, Coldfusion and most recently Scala. As well as spending a reasonable amount of time building applications for the web, which has given me an exposure to a range of javascript technologies over the years, through jQuery, extjs, knockout, backbone and most recently to React. <br/><br/>
  I enjoy building interesting products, with a good Product Management focus and a good emphasis on good engineering principles and clean code (having worked across differing languages on the JVM, I recognise that good code is contextual).<br/><br/>
  I have worked in large scale consultancy roles across Europe as well as a mix of startup experience (including one that was acquired) and I am currently the Chief Technology Officer at a legal-tech startup called <a href="https://www.basementcrowd.com" target="_blank">Basement Crowd</a> where we are building innovative products to serve the legal industry.

#An additional info freetext section is optional at the bottom of the page - can be text or HTML

   <strong>Scala</strong>: My current role uses Scala as the primary language and have been building applications in Scala for the last two years. I am familiar with a range of Scala libraries, such as <a target="_blank" href="http://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/2017/12/an-opinionated-guide-to-building-apis.html"> Akka-Http for building microservices</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/2018/09/generic-programming-with-scala.html"> Shapeless for generic programming</a>, as well as familiar with a range of <a target="_blank" href="https://basementcrowd.com/2018/11/28/scala-the-aux-pattern-path-dependent-types/" >functional programming techniques available</a>.<br/><br/>
   <strong>Java</strong>: I am experienced in a variety of Java APIâ€™s and frameworks. I have worked with Spring 4, Spring Boot, JPA (Hibernate and EclipseLink) in addition to others. <br/><br/>
   <strong>Groovy</strong> I have used Groovy as a language in production for ~4 years and I am familiar with many of the languages features (such as writing <a target='_blank' href="https://dzone.com/articles/functional-programming-groovy">Functional Programming style groovy</a>) and quirks (such as <a target="_blank" href="https://dzone.com/articles/groovy-retrospective-an-addendum-memory-usage-perm">memory leak issues</a>). <br/><br/>
   <strong>Cloud platforms</strong>: I have primarily used AWS for running production apps on the cloud. I have experience setting up, configuring and running applications using a range of AWS offerings, including EC2, RDS, S3, Cogito, <a target="_blank" href="http://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/2018/05/serverless-with-aws-lambda-scala.html">Lambda</a> and its more recent <a target="_blank" href="http://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/2018/10/machine-learning-with-aws-scala.html">Machine Learning capabilities</a>.<br/><br/>
   <strong>Web Development</strong>: Through building web applications, I have also worked with various client side technology, having used jQuery, Bootstrap, LESS, SASS, Backbone/Underscore/Require. More recently I have written React applications (primarily using the Create React App framework, and extending them)<br/><br/>
   <strong>Development Control</strong>: I have a good knowledge of application life-cycle management and have worked with SVN, Git, Maven, Gradle, Sonar, Jenkins, TeamCity, etc. I have experience with an array of testing tools and technologies.<br/><br/>
   I have also gained experience and knowledge of other technologies from several side projects and research that I have undertaken in my free time, including Android, a variety of social APIs (Twitter etc) and cloud platforms such as CloudFoundry/OpenShift/AppFog/AWS. <br/><br/>
   As part of Nerdability, I created, and am now primary contributor to, two Spring projects - <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/robhinds/spring-social-geeklist">Spring-Social-Geeklist</a> and <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/nerdability/spring-social-khan-academy">Spring-Social-Khan-Academy</a>, which provide core integration with those third-party APIs on top of the Spring Social framework. They are both listed as community projects: <a target='_blank' href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-social/">http://projects.spring.io/spring-social/</a>. <br/><br/>
   I write a blog covering technical and opinion articles that can be found here: <a target='_blank' href="http://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/">automateddeveloper.blogspot.com</a> (I am also a <a target='_blank' href="https://dzone.com/users/899489/rhinds.html">DZone MVB</a>)
